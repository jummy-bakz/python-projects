## Python Projects

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under jupyter notebook. I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries
(Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn)

# Project 1 : COVID 19 dataset

# Project 2 : The TMDb movie data
# Dataset

* The TMDb movie data (cleaned from original data on Kaggle).

* This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.


# Libraries:

* All the codes are written on Jupiter notebook. The python libraries include numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

# Project 3 : Data Analysis with No-show Movie appointments
